# This project aims to create an accessible store for the helpdesk ticketing system due for retirement. 

Eventually, we agreed to create an SSRS report. Emailable to research if a similar problem existed in the past. And prehaps the technician documented the solution.

Since this is a static database, you can access all the data in the legacy system and the SSRS I developed to replace the old system.
